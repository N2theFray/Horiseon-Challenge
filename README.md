## Comments
This project was created as a week 1 challenge for UCF full-stack developer bootcamp.
I found the project to be challenging, however the difficulties i found were due to an imperfect understanding of how the block system works.

Overall I was satisfied with the final product. I was curious to find that this was rather inefficient compared to flexboxes. I considered going back to rewrite the code using flex syntax but I didn't learn that until the second week content so felt that it exceeded the scope/intent of the challenge.

One issue i had was that I did not discover until turn in day was that i wasn't commiting to an initialized repository that was live on Github. So i created a repository on Github, cloned the file to my local, then shifted the content from where it was to its current directory.  ðŸ¤·
